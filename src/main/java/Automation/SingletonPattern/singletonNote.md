# Singleton Design Pattern in Automation Frameworks

## What is the Singleton Pattern?
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it throughout the application's lifecycle. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to control the instantiation of a class to a single instance, such as managing global resources or ensuring thread safety.

## Why Use Singleton in Automation Frameworks?
In automation frameworks, such as those using Selenium WebDriver, managing resources like WebDriver instances efficiently is crucial. Using the Singleton pattern ensures:
- **Resource Efficiency:** Only one WebDriver instance is created and reused across tests, optimizing memory usage.
- **Global Access:** Provides a centralized point to access WebDriver throughout the framework, avoiding conflicts and ensuring consistent behavior.

## How to Implement Singleton in Automation Frameworks?

### Example Implementation in Java:
Here's a basic example of implementing the Singleton pattern for managing a WebDriver instance in Java:
> Note: For code implementation refer the Code files instead of code snippet below.
```java
public class WebDriverSingleton {
    private static WebDriver driver;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private WebDriverSingleton() {}

    // Static method to get the WebDriver instance
    public static WebDriver getDriver() {
        if (driver == null) {
            // Initialize WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, etc.)
            driver = new ChromeDriver();
        }
        return driver;
    }
}
```


## Explanation:
- **Private Constructor:** Ensures that no other class can instantiate the WebDriverSingleton class directly.
- **Static Instance**: driver is a static variable, ensuring only one instance exists across the application.
- **Lazy Initialization**: WebDriver instance is created only when getDriver() method is first called, not during class loading.
- **Thread Safety**: While this basic implementation is not thread-safe, you can enhance it using synchronized blocks or the double-checked locking pattern for thread safety in multi-threaded environments.
