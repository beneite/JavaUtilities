The `docker-compose.yml` file you've provided sets up a service to build and run a Java program image called `multiplynumberjava:v1` with two environment variables: `NUMBER1` and `NUMBER2`. Here's a breakdown:

### Explanation of the Compose File:
- **`version: "3"`**: Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.
- **`services`**: Defines the services to be run by Docker Compose.
    - **`java-program-service`**: The name of the service.
        - **`build: .`**: Instructs Docker to build an image from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory (`.`).
        - **`image: multiplynumberjava:v1`**: Names the built image as `multiplynumberjava:v1`.
        - **`environment`**: Sets up environment variables for the container.
            - `NUMBER1=2`: Sets `NUMBER1` to `2`.
            - `NUMBER2=4`: Sets `NUMBER2` to `4`.

### Additional Notes:
1. Ensure you have a `Dockerfile` in the same directory as this `docker-compose.yml`.
    - The `Dockerfile` should include the necessary commands to compile and run your Java program.
2. The Java program should be designed to read `NUMBER1` and `NUMBER2` from the environment variables.
    - In Java, you can access these values using `System.getenv("NUMBER1")` and `System.getenv("NUMBER2")`.
3. Run the Compose file with:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   This will build the image and start the container with the specified environment variables.
