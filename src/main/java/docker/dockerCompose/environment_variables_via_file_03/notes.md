Here’s an explanation of your `docker-compose.yml` file that includes comments about passing the `VERSION` variable from an `.env` file:

```yaml
# passing the VERSION from .env file
# vinsdocker/sel-app:${V1}
# vinsdocker/sel-app:${V2}
# vinsdocker/sel-app:${V3}
version: "3"
services:
  env-from-file:
    image: vinsdocker/sel-app:${VERSION}
    ports:
      - 8050:8
```

### Explanation

1. **Comments**:
   ```yaml
   # passing the VERSION from .env file
   # vinsdocker/sel-app:${V1}
   # vinsdocker/sel-app:${V2}
   # vinsdocker/sel-app:${V3}
   ```
    - These comments indicate that the `VERSION` variable is sourced from an external `.env` file.
    - The commented lines provide examples of how different versions (`V1`, `V2`, `V3`) could be used to tag the Docker image for the `vinsdocker/sel-app` application.

2. **Version**:
   ```yaml
   version: "3"
   ```
    - This specifies that the Docker Compose file is using version 3 of the Compose file format.

3. **Services**:
   ```yaml
   services:
   ```
    - This section defines the services managed by Docker Compose.

4. **Service Name**:
   ```yaml
   env-from-file:
   ```
    - This is the name of the service. In this case, it’s called `env-from-file`. This will also be the name of the container when it is created.

5. **Image**:
   ```yaml
   image: vinsdocker/sel-app:${VERSION}
   ```
    - This specifies the Docker image to be used for the container. The `${VERSION}` syntax means that the actual version of the image will be substituted at runtime based on the value of the `VERSION` environment variable defined in the `.env` file.
    - The image is expected to follow the format `vinsdocker/sel-app:<version_tag>`.

6. **Ports**:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - 8050:8
   ```
    - This section maps port 8050 on the host machine to port 8 on the container. This means that if you access `localhost:8050` on your host, it will connect to port 8 in the running container.
    - Note that the port mapping usually expects the second port (the container's port) to be a valid exposed port in the Docker image.

### Summary

- The `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service named `env-from-file` that uses a Docker image (`vinsdocker/sel-app`) with a tag that is determined by the `VERSION` variable sourced from an external `.env` file.
- This setup allows for easy version management and flexibility, as you can change the version of the image by simply updating the `VERSION` variable in your `.env` file.
- The service will listen on port 8050 on the host machine, which is mapped to port 8 inside the container.

This configuration is particularly useful in environments where you need to deploy different versions of an application easily without modifying the Docker Compose file itself. Let me know if you have any further questions!
