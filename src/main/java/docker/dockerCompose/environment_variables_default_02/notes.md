## Here’s a breakdown of your `docker-compose.yml` configuration for the `multipy_2_Number` service:
<br>
<br>

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  multipy_2_Number:
    image: beneite/docker_learning:multiply2numbers_fix
    environment:
      - NUMBER1=${NUM1:-10}
      - NUMBER2=${NUM2:-12}
```

### Explanation

1. **Version**:
   ```yaml
   version: "3"
   ```
    - This specifies that the Docker Compose file is using version 3 of the Compose file format.

2. **Services**:
   ```yaml
   services:
   ```
    - This section defines the services that Docker Compose will manage. Each service corresponds to a container.

3. **Service Name**:
   ```yaml
   multipy_2_Number:
   ```
    - This is the name of the service. In this case, it’s called `multipy_2_Number`. This will also be the name of the container when it is created.

4. **Image**:
   ```yaml
   image: beneite/docker_learning:multiply2numbers_fix
   ```
    - This specifies the Docker image to be used for the container. Here, it refers to an image hosted on Docker Hub (or another registry) with the name `beneite/docker_learning` and the tag `multiply2numbers_fix`. This image should contain the logic to multiply two numbers.

5. **Environment Variables**:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - NUMBER1=${NUM1:-10}
     - NUMBER2=${NUM2:-12}
   ```
    - This section defines environment variables that will be passed to the container when it runs.
    - **`NUMBER1=${NUM1:-10}`**: This sets the `NUMBER1` variable inside the container to the value of the host environment variable `NUM1`. If `NUM1` is not set, it defaults to `10`.
    - **`NUMBER2=${NUM2:-12}`**: Similarly, this sets `NUMBER2` to the value of the host environment variable `NUM2`, defaulting to `12` if `NUM2` is not set.

### Summary

- The `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service named `multipy_2_Number` that uses a specific Docker image for multiplying two numbers.
- It allows you to specify values for the numbers via environment variables (`NUM1` and `NUM2`). If those variables are not defined in your host environment, it defaults to `10` for `NUMBER1` and `12` for `NUMBER2`.
- This setup is useful for easily customizing the input numbers when you run the container without modifying the code in the Docker image.
