Hereâ€™s an explanation of your `docker-compose.yml` file that includes comments about passing environment variables from specific `.env` files and how to invoke them:

```yaml
# passing the VERSION from .env file
# .env -> {VERSION=v1; PORT=30}
# dev.env -> {VERSION=v2; PORT=40}
# qa.env -> {VERSION=v3; PORT=50}
# use command: docker-compose --env-file qa.env up
# to invoke a particular env file
version: "3"
services:
  env-from-file:
    image: vinsdocker/sel-app:${VERSION}
    ports:
      - ${PORT}:80
```

### Explanation

1. **Comments on Environment Files**:
    - The comments indicate that different environment files are available:
        - `.env`: Sets `VERSION` to `v1` and `PORT` to `30`.
        - `dev.env`: Sets `VERSION` to `v2` and `PORT` to `40`.
        - `qa.env`: Sets `VERSION` to `v3` and `PORT` to `50`.
    - These variables can be used to customize the configuration based on the environment.

2. **Command to Invoke a Specific Environment File**:
   ```yaml
   # use command: docker-compose --env-file qa.env up
   ```
    - This comment explains how to run the Docker Compose command using a specific environment file. In this case, running:
      ```bash
      docker-compose --env-file qa.env up
      ```
      ```bash
      docker-compose --env-file dev.env up
      ```
    - This command will set the environment variables for the service based on the values defined in `qa.env`.

3. **Version**:
   ```yaml
   version: "3"
   ```
    - This specifies that the Docker Compose file is using version 3 of the Compose file format.

4. **Services**:
   ```yaml
   services:
   ```
    - This section defines the services managed by Docker Compose.

5. **Service Name**:
   ```yaml
   env-from-file:
   ```
    - This is the name of the service. In this case, it's called `env-from-file`.

6. **Image**:
   ```yaml
   image: vinsdocker/sel-app:${VERSION}
   ```
    - This specifies the Docker image to be used for the container. The `${VERSION}` placeholder will be replaced with the value from the specified environment file (e.g., `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`).

7. **Ports**:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - ${PORT}:80
   ```
    - This section maps the external port (specified by `${PORT}` in the environment file) to port `80` inside the container.
    - Depending on the environment file used, the external port will change accordingly (e.g., `30`, `40`, or `50`).

### Summary

- The `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service named `env-from-file` that uses a Docker image (`vinsdocker/sel-app`) with a version specified by the `VERSION` variable from an external environment file.
- The port mapping is also dynamic, allowing you to expose different ports based on the environment configuration.
- By using the command `docker-compose --env-file qa.env up`, you can easily switch between different environment configurations without modifying the Compose file itself.

This setup allows for flexible deployment in various environments (development, testing, production) with minimal changes. Let me know if you have any further questions!
