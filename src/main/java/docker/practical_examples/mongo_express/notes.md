This `docker-compose.yaml` file looks correctly set up for running MongoDB with `mongo-express` as the web interface. Here's a quick summary of what's going on:

### Key Components:
1. **MongoDB Service (`mongo-service`):**
    - **Image**: `mongo` is used as the MongoDB database image.
    - **Environment**:
        - `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin`: This sets the MongoDB root username to `admin`.
        - `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password`: This sets the root password to `password`.
    - **Volumes**:
        - `./data:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`: This mounts the local directory `./data` to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` in the container. You can place any MongoDB initialization scripts in the `data` folder.

2. **Mongo-Express Service (`mongo-express-service`):**
    - **Image**: The `mongo-express` image is used for running a web-based interface to manage MongoDB.
    - **Ports**:
        - `8030:8081`: Exposes port `8081` of the container to `8030` on your host machine. This allows you to access `mongo-express` at `http://localhost:8030`.
    - **Depends On**:
        - `depends_on: - mongo-service`: This ensures the `mongo-express` service starts only after `mongo-service` is running.
    - **Environment**:
        - `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: admin`: This is the MongoDB admin username, which should match the credentials set in the `mongo-service`.
        - `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: password`: This is the MongoDB admin password, matching the root password.
        - `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER: mongo-service`: This sets the MongoDB host to the service name `mongo-service`, so `mongo-express` can connect to the database.
        - `ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH: false`: This disables the login prompt for the `mongo-express` web interface.

### Steps After Running:
1. Run `docker-compose up`:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. After the services start, access `mongo-express` through your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8030
   ```

Since you've set `ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH: false`, there won't be a login prompt, and you'll be able to interact with MongoDB directly from the `mongo-express` UI.

If you encounter any issues with accessing MongoDB, make sure:
- Both services are running properly (`docker ps` will list the running containers).
- The logs don't show any errors (`docker-compose logs mongo-service` and `docker-compose logs mongo-express-service`).
