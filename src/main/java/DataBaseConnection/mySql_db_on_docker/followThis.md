This Docker Compose configuration sets up two services: a MySQL database (`mysql-service`) and Adminer (`adminer-service`), a web-based database management tool. Here's a breakdown of each section:

### 1. **Version**
```yaml
version: "3"
```
- Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. This tells Docker Compose which features and syntax to use. (As mentioned earlier, this line is now considered obsolete and can be removed without affecting functionality.)

### 2. **Services**
This section defines the different services (containers) that Docker Compose will manage.

#### a. **MySQL Service (`mysql-service`)**
```yaml
mysql-service:
  image: mysql
  environment:
    MYSQL_USER: ashish
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: ashish@123
    MYSQL_DATABASE: students_db
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ashish@123
  volumes:
    - ./init_script:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```
- **Image**:
    - `image: mysql` specifies that the official MySQL image from Docker Hub will be used.

- **Environment Variables**:
    - `MYSQL_USER`: Sets the MySQL user to `ashish`.
    - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Sets the password for the user `ashish` to `ashish@123`.
    - `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Creates a database named `students_db` upon initialization.
    - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Sets the root user's password to `ashish@123`.

- **Volumes**:
    - `./init_script:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`: This mounts a local directory named `init_script` to the container's `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory. Any SQL scripts in this directory will be executed automatically when the MySQL container is initialized. This is useful for setting up tables, seeding data, or any other initialization tasks.

#### b. **Adminer Service (`adminer-service`)**
```yaml
adminer-service:
  image: adminer
  ports:
    - 8070:8080
```
- **Image**:
    - `image: adminer` specifies that the official Adminer image will be used.

- **Ports**:
    - `8070:8080`: This maps port `8070` on the host machine to port `8080` in the Adminer container. You can access Adminer by visiting `http://localhost:8070` in your web browser.

### Summary
- **MySQL Service**: Initializes a MySQL database with a user and specific database setup, and can execute SQL scripts for further initialization.
- **Adminer Service**: Provides a web interface for managing the MySQL database and can be accessed on port `8070` of the host.

### To Run This Setup
1. Save this configuration in a file called `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Run the following command to start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Accessing Adminer
After running the setup, you can access Adminer via:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:8070`
- **System**: MySQL
- **Server**: `mysql-service` (or `localhost` if necessary)
- **Username**: `ashish`
- **Password**: `ashish@123`
- **Database**: `students_db`
